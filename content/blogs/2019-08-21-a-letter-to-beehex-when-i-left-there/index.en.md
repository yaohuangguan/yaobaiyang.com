Working in Beehex is just nice and comfortable, people can task themselves on the real world project. 

BeeHex current hardware equipment is outstanding and unique in the market.

I am proud of us and I hope BeeHex software can also keep growing. 

With the UserInterfaces for deco-pod and nutri-pod and the cookiecannon

I wish BeeHex could really grasp this huge oppotunity and could really take off. 

For using the cookiecannon, I suggest we should use the power of google search engine Adwords,Instagram Ads is a good place to advertise the website. 

Also, YouTube is helpful when we have advertising videos. I like the cookie cannon idea and people going to love it as well. 

Before we do that , we need to upgrade the database plan and switch to EB and do some traffic testing. Once we can accept large volume of customers and people are getting to know cookiecannon, I think that moment is when BeeHex really enters next level. 

3 months experience, I really learned a lot and I appreciate this oppotunity to work with awesome people. Thank you Anjan and Ben for the continuous help on everything. 

After this internship, I feel like I still have a lot to learn, about working, about living,etc.. Just like BeeHex is growing and growing. 

There might be obstacles on the way to success, but I hope and believe the future of BeeHex is bright and successful.



I wrote this last year, as you can see the date there. Man, <strong>I miss BeeHex and everyone else.</strong> 

They are just awesome, and I had a great time with them together. I wish I could have a chance to go back and do it all over again.  I found this letter by chance and looked through it. thought it's interesting how I was thinking about BeeHex and this whole thing. So I'd just share this as a post with you guys. Haven't posted any article lately...  times been short for me... lots of work to do!! Maybe I would find some spare time and write some posts step by step... I have a post right around the cornor, its about TypeScript usage, i hope my readers, you all will like it!!
